This project is designed to ease the process of keeping track of my
finances. More specifically, I'd like to keep track of month to
month changes of my bank account.

The input is a well-formatted excel file that holds the amounts in my various
accounts. The output is an excel file with a summary sheet and sheets for each
individual tabulation.

Progress:
  Start with known excel files, input is input.xlsx, output is
  FinanceSummary.xlsx

  Analysis done for 1 month difference, 6 month difference, 1 year difference.

  Analysis now done for 1, 3, 6, 9 months, and 1 year.
  Archive sheet holds data from more than 1 year ago so that sheets bar doesn't get
  overloaded.
  As of now, done with bank total portion, except for sheet name.
  Onto loans to individuals info.
  After that, possibly include student loans info.

Goal:
  Input and output files can be declared as parameters of the
  program. (DONE)
  Add analysis for 3 month difference, 9 month difference.
  Create archive file that holds data from more than 1 year ago so that excel file doesn't
  get overloaded.
  More analysis will be done eventually.
  Possibly add more for loans to individuals, other aspects of finances such as student loans.
