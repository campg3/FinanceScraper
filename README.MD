This project is designed to ease the process of keeping track of my
finances. More specifically, I'd like to keep track of month to
month changes of my bank account.

The input is a well-formatted excel file that holds the amounts in my various
accounts. The output is an excel file with a summary sheet and sheets for each
individual tabulation.

Current Status:
  Program takes an input file and a desired output file. It handles whether or not the output file
  has been used yet or not.
  The input file should have well-formatted inputs inside. Currently, it should say Bank Account in A1,
  Then, going down, it should say Checking, Savings, Money Market with the respective totals in the
  adjacent columns (B2, B3, B4)
  The output file will have a summary sheet along with an archive of all the bank account tracking
  The summary sheet will have the current total along with various deltas over certain periods of time

Future Status:
  Program will also handle individual investments/loans, student debt, etc. All in a similar fashion
